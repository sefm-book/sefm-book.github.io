# Virtual Machines

Here you find virtual machines which provide easy access to the tools and resources used in the book.

You will need [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) to run these virtual machines. You will need at least 2GB of memory (preferably 4GB).

To use these, download the virtual machine ova file and open it with VirtualBox. This will start an import where you can tweak certain settings such as the amount of virtual memory and number of virtual processors (you can increase these if you wish).

* Version 22.09 (September 2022)
  * [Download](https://tc1.me/sefm-book-vm-2022-09)
  * Contains: The tools FDR, Hets, and Congu (installed  and ready to use); the [source files](additional-material-for-selected-chapters.md) for the Chapters 3, 4 and 8.
  * Known Issues:
    * Upon launching FDR, and after dealing with the licence window, the main window is placed under the top menu bar. This makes it impossible to move the window by dragging the title bar of the FDR window (as it is under the menu bar). However, the window can be moved by holding Alt and then clicking and dragging anywhere in the window.
    * Launching FDR via the command line causes some warnings/errors which seem harmless.
