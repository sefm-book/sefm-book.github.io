# Virtual Machines

Here you find virtual machines which provide easy access to the tools and resources used in the book.

You will need [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) to run these virtual machines. You will need at least 2GB of memory (preferably 4GB).

To use these, download the virtual machine ova file and open it with VirtualBox. This will start an import where you can tweak certain settings such as the amount of virtual memory and number of virtual processors (you can increase these if you wish).
